SRL.FindDTMInTBA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: pascal

 function TSRL.FindDTMInTBA(DTM: Integer; Areas: TBoxArray; MaxToFind: Int32 = 0): TIntArray;

Searches for the DTM in all of the boxes `Areas`. You can specify a max to find ``MaxToFind`` so that it breaks 
out early, and doesn't spend more time than what's needed. By default it's 0, which means find them all.
